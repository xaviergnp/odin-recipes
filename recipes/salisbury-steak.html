            <p>This Salisbury steak recipe comes together 
                quickly and does not need a lot of time 
                in the slow cooker. It's a delicious way 
                to add flavor to ground beef and the 
                children love it! The gravy is delightful 
                served over mashed potatoes.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
                <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>¼ cup milk</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup
                     mix</li>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream 
                    of chicken soup</li>
                <li>¾ cup water</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) packet dry au jus mix</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk,
                     and onion soup mix together in a large 
                     bowl until well combined; shape into 8
                      patties.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high 
                    heat. Dredge patties in flour just to coat, 
                    and quickly brown on both sides in the hot 
                    skillet. Place browned patties into the slow 
                    cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid.</li>
                <li>Mix condensed soup, water, and au jus mix 
                    together in a medium bowl; pour over the 
                    beef patties. Cook on Low until ground beef 
                    is well done, about 4 to 5 hours.</li>
